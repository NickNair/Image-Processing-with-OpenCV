#       IMAGE PROCESSING USING OPENCV

#                             ABSTRACT

We hope that after completing this SMP you will have a better understanding of the
tools that enable everyday image processing tasks such as: noise removal and image
restoration, object and face detection and common filtering operations like edge
detection.
